## CheckIn 05

#### Dana Rose:
#### What have you contributed to the project between the last check in and this check in?
- I have contributed work towards figuring out the navigation for our app. It is not yet finished, but I believe I am on the right track.

#### What have you learned between the last check in and this check in?
- I have learned a little bit about SQL and data storage.

#### What do you need help with?
- I need help with the navigation. I continue to think I understand what is going on, but everytime I change the code in an attempt to correctly navigate to the next screen, the app closes down instead.

#### What do you expect to complete between the next check in and this check in?
- I expect to complete the navigation along with the finishing touches on the app.
