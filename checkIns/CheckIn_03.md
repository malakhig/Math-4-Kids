#### Dana Rose:
##### What have you contributed to the project between the last check in and this check in? 
- Between last check in and this check in, I have contributed help to the creation of our select screen, game screen, and our future plans for our games that will be available in the app.

##### What have you learned between the last check in and this check in?
- Between last check in and this check in, I have learned how to create different screens and about drawers and how they work.This will be helpful if we decide to include a drawer for navigation purposes.

##### What do you need help with?
- I could use some extra help on navigation. I understand there is supposed to be a NavController, a NavGraph, and a NavHost, but I struggle to know when to use them and how to properly connect all of our screens.

##### What do you expect to complete between the next check in and this check in?
- Bewtween this check in and next check in, I expect to have our screens connected and have some sort of navigation. I also expect to our new screens to have some sort of functionality.
