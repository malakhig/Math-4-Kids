## CheckIn 02

#### Dana Rose:
##### What have you contributed to the project between the last check in and this check in? 
- Between last check in and this check in, I have contributed help to the creation of our select screen, game screen, and our future plans for our games that will be available in the app.

##### What have you learned between the last check in and this check in?
- Between last check in and this check in, I have learned how to create different screens and about drawers and how they work.This will be helpful if we decide to include a drawer for navigation purposes.

##### What do you need help with?
- I could use some extra help on navigation. I understand there is supposed to be a NavController, a NavGraph, and a NavHost, but I struggle to know when to use them and how to properly connect all of our screens.

##### What do you expect to complete between the next check in and this check in?
- Between this check in and next check in, I expect to have our screens connected and have some sort of navigation. I also expect to our new screens to have some sort of functionality.

#### Malakhi Griffin:
##### What have you contributed to the project between the last check in and this check in?
- I helped create more screens that will be used for final app like the select screen and game screen.

##### What have you learned between the last check in and this check in?
-I have learned about navigation and using state flow within the project the alternate the screens and swtich between them.

##### What do you need help with?
- Although I sort of know how to use NavHost I still need practice with navigation. I also know about state flow academically I'm not sure how to use it pratically within the app that we're building.

##### What do you expect to complete between the next check in and this check in?
- I hope to complete the select screen and the game screen navigation and UI. Also I would like to complete the addition page and the subtraction page UI and functionality.
