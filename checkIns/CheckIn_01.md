**What have you contributed to the project between the last check in and this check in?**

I have contributed work towards creating the login screen for our app. I have also contributed ideas for future implementation.

I have learned how to use columns and rows to create a specific UI look on an app screen. I have also learned how to work collaboratively on a repository while multiple members are working at the same time.


**What do you need help with?**

I could use some more help on proper syntax in compose and implementation overall & user Authentication or pressing a button and being taken to another screen.



**What do you expect to complete between the next check in and this check in?**

I expect to add another page after the login screen and possibly add some functionality.
