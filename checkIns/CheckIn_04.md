## CheckIn 02

#### Dana Rose:
##### What have you contributed to the project between the last check in and this check in? 
- Between last check in and this check in, I have worked on our navigation between screens. I have not finished it completely yet, but I am still in the process of getting it to be completely functional.

##### What have you learned between the last check in and this check in?
- Between last check in and this check in, I have learned in more detail the steps to implement navigation. By attempting to do it on my own, I think I am able to grasp the idea better.

##### What do you need help with?
- There are a couple aspects of navigation that I am still struggling with. Some of my confusion comes from how to correctly lead to another page through a button click.

##### What do you expect to complete between the next check in and this check in?
- Between this check in and the next check in, I plan to have the navigation running properly.
